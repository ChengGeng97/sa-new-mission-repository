### Assignment Briefing (Click to Edit!)
Welcome to Assignment Creator! This is where the Briefing for each assignment will appear.

If you are on the SourceAcademy website, you may edit **this section** by clicking on it. You can also add or delete questions through the control bar.

The text written here will show up as the `README.md` file on the GitHub repository.

Please also refer to our instructor's guide [here](https://github.com/source-academy/general/tree/master/instructor/github) to learn more about how to use this website.

### Brief Markdown Cheatsheet
Everything here is written in Markdown.

This means that you can **bolden** or *italicize* text by adding asterisks.

Programs can be formatted through the use of triple backticks:
```
// This is a program example
```
If you want to in-line program snippets, rather than display it as a block, you can also use single backticks like `this`.

Lists can be created by adding dashes to the start of a line:
- First element
- Second element
- Third element


It is also possible to embed images, like this:
